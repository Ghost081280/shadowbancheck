# Shadow Ban & Hashtag Safety Platform

> **Stop wasting your reach.** Check if you're shadow banned and if your hashtags are killing your posts before you hit publish.

---

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

**Creators are losing thousands of followers and millions of impressions** without knowing why:

- Using ONE banned hashtag tanks your entire post on Instagram
- Shadow bans kill your reach for weeks and you don't even know it's happening
- Email deliverability issues cost businesses thousands in lost revenue
- No single tool checks everything in one place

**We're building the solution.**
